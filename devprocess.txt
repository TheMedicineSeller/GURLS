1. GO for URL shortening and making the RESTful API that performs the shortening service. Using Redis DB for persisting the URLs that have been shortened.
2. Dockerise the application (Dockerfiles for api and redis db and then compose them).
3. A front end form page that takes in a URL and shortens it and lets the User copy the URL. - in HTML, CSS and FLask 


First implementing the API and testing it using CURL from cmd
