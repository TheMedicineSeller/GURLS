# G-URLS
You need some G-URLS in your life. GURLS standing for Golang-URL-Shortener.

URL shortener written using golang. It uses a REST API that communicates with a Redis Database for persisting the URLs that have been shortened. Used gin-gonic for the REST service and go-redis for interfacing with Redis DB.

P.S : All the code was written in vim on Windows 10 cmd provided by the wonderful [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils)
