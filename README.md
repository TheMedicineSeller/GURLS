# GURLS
You need some GURLS in your life. GURLS standing for GO-URL-Shortener.

URL shortener written using golang. It uses a REST API that communicates with a Redis Database for persisting the URLs that have been shortened. Used gin-gonic for the REST service and go-redis for interfacing with Redis DB.
